      <p>It was interesting to see the two different responsive page designs. I would say that bootstrap makes it a lot easier to make pages as it has a lot of built in features. Although, because of the amount of features, it creates a large learning curve to use it effectively. The column format with media views is straightforward as you define everything and logically each part makes sense as it builds on the previous step. In regards to challenges, I found it helpful to utilize stack overflow to see examples and there was quite a few examples on bootstrap. They also have very comprehensive documentation. The specific challenges I encountered though were in regards to actually applying the content to the page, as I was confused on how to stack the elements if the screen got small enough. Bootstrap did this automatically which was really nice, although I was unable to get the images to be in columns, so I had to add some custom css to fix this. To continue, Bootstrap seems more unpredictable because you are loading external CSS so after some research, I concluded the bootstrap scripts should be kept on the server, so it will always have a predictable output. You also will not be relying on external sources to host a significant part of your web page. Therefore, to be honest, both had their challenges and thus I did not have a preference for one or the other. </p>
